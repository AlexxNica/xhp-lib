XHP-Lib 2.0 was released yesterday, which included the conversion to Hack -
XHP-Lib 1.x is still supported for PHP5 users.

Highlights include:

 - `AwaitableXHP` added; this allows you to build efficient XHP components wher
   data fetching requirements are an implementation detail instead of part of the
   API they present
 - Attribute coercion is now much stricter, and raises an E_DEPRECATED. In a
   future release, the Hack typechecker will consider any coercion to be an
   error, and XHP-Lib will throw an exception

See [the full release notes](https://github.com/facebook/xhp-lib/releases/tag/2.0.0) for more.

[XHP-Bootstrap](https://github.com/hhvm/xhp-bootstrap) 1.0.0rc1 has also been
released, which is compatible with XHP-Lib 2.0.
